# An Anaylsis of Kickstarter Campaigns
*I Performed a kickstarter analysis to assist Louise in making a decision about her funding
# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
    The purpose of this analysis was to show how successful or unsuccesful a Kickstarter was based on the launch date and the goal.

## Analysis and Challenges
    The analysis I used were the [COUNTIFS](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/countifs-function-dda3dc6e-f74e-4aee-88bc-aa8c2a866842) COUNTIFS, SUM, & ROUND function. The only challenge I faced was with deliverable 2. My chart was not correct due to sorting and creating multiple columns from the main Kickstarter page. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
    The first conclusion I that there were no canceled Kickstarters in October. The bests month for a successful Kickstarter are May and June. They were the only months to have at least 100 successful Kickstarters. On the 66% for May. 65% for June
