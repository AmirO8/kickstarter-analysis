### Purpose
 The purpose of this analysis was to show how successful or unsuccesful a Kickstarter was based on the launch date and the goal.'

![Theather Outcomes vs Lauch](https://github.com/AmirO8/kickstarter-analysis/blob/main/Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png)

   From May 2009 to January 2017 there were 1369 theather Kickstarters. Of those 1369 839 were successful, 493 failed and 37 were canceled. The month of May had the most total successful Kickstarters at 111 and the month of December had the least total successful Kickstarters. However the total number per each month varied May had the most with December having the least. 
   Even though there are many Kickstarters started in May that is when I would recommend starting one. There are not many Kickstarters launched in December. When they less than 50% are successful.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
  The most common goal total for a Kickstarter is between 1,000 and 4,999. The yield the most successful Kickstarters. However when we take a look at the percentage of the Kickstarters that are successful the ones that request less than 1,000 are the most successful at 75.81%

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results
   Lauching a Kickstarter in December doesn't yield a good success rate. Lauching a Kickstarter in May yields the hist success rate for a Kickstarter.
    If I want my Kickstarter to be successful I will need to
